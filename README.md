# muse_validation_pipeline
Contains tools to download and compare numerical models with SDO/AIA, SDO/HMI, Hinode/EIS, and IRIS datasets with the aim of validating numerical models for use in MUSE data modeling.
Also linked this repo with muse_science slack channel. Created a separate private channel called `museval`.
